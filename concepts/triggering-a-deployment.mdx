## How it works

Deployments are triggered when a series of conditions are all met. These conditions are written in Javascript in the dashboard. 

In the dashboard, you may have the conditions:

```javascript
// the deployment can only be triggered up to 5 times per session
session.deployments["deployment_id"].views < 5
```

```javascript
// the deployment can only be triggered up to 20 in the users lifetime
user.deployments["deployment_id"].views < 20
```


```javascript
// the deployment is triggered every other time the event is triggered in the session
session.events.event_id.count % 2 === 1
```

Only when all three of these conditions are met at the same time will the deployment be triggered. The user must have triggered the event 1, 3, 5, 7 etc.. times and cannot have seen the deployment more than 5 times in a given session and 20 times over their life. 

<Tip>Most deployments will have either a session view cap and a lifetime view cap. Otherwise it will show on page load every single time.</Tip>

## You have access to data in the following shape

### Session object
Data in the session object is retained only for the duration of the session. 
```typescript
// represents the session of the user that is detroyed when the user closes the website
export type session = {
   events: {
      [event_id: string]: {
         // how many times the event has been triggered in the session
         count: number;
      };
   };
   deployments: {
      [deployment_id: string]: {
         // how many times the deployment has been viewed in the session
         views: number;
      };
   };
   // when querying against session.duration, always use > or < because its unlikely to be equal to the duration.
   duration: number; // seconds
};
```

### User object
Data in the user object is retained over the lifetime of the user.
```typescript
// properties in the user object are retained over the lifetime of the user.

export type user = {
    events: {
      [eventId: string]: {
         // counts in the user's lifetime
         count: number;
      };
   };
   deployments: {
      [event_id: string]: {
         // how many times the deployment has been triggered in the user's lifetime
         views: number;
         lastViewed: Date;
      };
   };
   sessions: {
      // how many sessions over the users lifetime
      count: number;
   };
};
```
