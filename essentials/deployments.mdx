## Start with an audience

Every deployment starts with an audience. If you'd like to deploy a message to everyone, you can select "Everyone." 

If you do select an audience, there is no way to override this even with a code trigger. It is impossible that a deployment will be shown to someone outside of the audience you selected.

## Choose a trigger
Every deployment must have an associated trigger. This can be an event triggered with code, or a page load. For example, user onboarding messages are often triggered by the page load event.

### Trigger schedules
Often, you will find yourself wanting to show a user a message after `x` number of event triggers, perhaps you show them how to use a feature after `x` attempts, then you show them again after `y` attempts as a reminder. 

You can configure that by placing multiple messages after the trigger event.

## Choose your sequence of messages
Every deployment must have an associated trigger. This can be an event triggered with code, or a page load. For example, user onboarding messages are often triggered by the page load event.
