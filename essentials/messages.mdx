## Modals
Modals are a message places in the center of the screen that requires user interaction to dismiss. They are used to display important information, perhaps like starting a user onboarding process or confirming a destructive action.

## Popovers
Popovers are a message that points to a specific element on the page. They are used to provide additional information about a specific element.

## Notifications
Notifications are messages that slide in from the top right of the screen. They are used to provide feedback to the user about an action they have taken, or to provide information in an unobtrusive way.
