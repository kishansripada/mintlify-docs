## Initialized user

Let's imagine we have a user object that looks like this:
```javascript
 hyperuser.initialize({
     userId: "test-id", // Unique identifier for the user, cannot be queried against
     apiKey: "<api_key>",
     user: {
        displayName: "Kishan Sripada",
        email: "kishan@umich.edu",
        languages: ["Javascript", "Python", "Java"],
        age: 25,
        income: 100_000,
        // you can literally put anything you want here
     },
 });
```

## Creating the audience: Students that know Javascript

In the Hyperuser dashboard, you can create an audience with the following filters:

```javascript
user.languages.includes("Javascript")
```
```javascript
user.email.endsWith(".edu")
```

<Tip>

Notice that we used pure Javascript to create the audience. Writing conditions where the **user** is the root object.
