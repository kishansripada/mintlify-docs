## Core Markdown Components

We use Github Flavored Markdown. You can find a guide [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Here are some examples of what you can do with markdown:

```mdx
# This is a large heading
```

```mdx
## This is a medium heading
```

```mdx
### This is a small heading
```

```mdx
This is a subtitle
```

## Core JSX Components
We also have prebuilt JSX components that we built specifically for onboarding.


```jsx
<Button variant="primary | secondary | outline">This is a button</Button>
```

```jsx
<Tip>This is a tip to the user</Tip>
```

```jsx
<Image src="your-image-src"/>
```


```jsx
<Tip>This is a tip to the user</Tip>
```


```jsx
<Steps/> //steps left in the onboarding
```

```jsx
<Grid cols="2"></Grid> // 2 column grid
```

## Overriding styles

You can also override the default styles of the components by using className and passing in [Tailwind CSS classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
```jsx
<Button className="bg-red-500 text-white">This is a button</Button>
```


## Examples

```jsx
#Hey there Kishan
This is a sample modal with some markdown content

<Tip>
Try holding shift when changing the formation duration on the timeline. 
</Tip>

<Button>Got it</Button>
```


```jsx
# Would you like to schedule a Zoom call with our founder?
Let us know if you're interested in a one-on-one Zoom call with our founder. Your feedback is valuable to us!

<Grid cols="2">
  <Button>Yes, I'm interested</Button>
  <Button variant="secondary">No, thanks</Button>
</Grid>
```
